Spikes
======

## Intro
This repo contains all the spikes performed for the sentiment analysis microservices.

Source code for spikes can be found by navigating to `src`.

If a spike needs a data to operate upon they can be found in `data/{spike_identifier}`. 
Since these dir may contain large files they have been omitted from version control.
As of now in order to reproduce a spike successfully, make sure the above defined directories exists, 
and ask the repo owner for data files. I have a plan to move the data files on some common storage later.

All the plots generated by the spike can be found in `plots/{spike_identifier}`.

In order to run a spike run the concerned shell script located under `bin` from root level of the repo.

## Dependencies
Spikes have been performed using Python version `3.7.3`.
Major dependencies include.
* `matplotlib`
